# Flutter Async API Example

This Flutter project showcases how to fetch data from an API asynchronously and display it using the `FutureBuilder` widget. The `MyWidget` class makes an HTTP request to a hypothetical API endpoint, and the UI is updated based on the asynchronous operation's state. To use the project, clone the repository, update the `apiUrl` with your desired API endpoint, install dependencies with `flutter pub get`, and run the app with `flutter run`. The project uses the `http` package for making HTTP requests, and contributions are welcome through issues or pull requests.
